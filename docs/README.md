### Trade Types
Rate: In the swaps market, the rate is the agreed upon exchange rate between two parties in the contract. A simple use case could be a plain vanilla interest rate swap, where one party agrees to pay a fixed rate, while the other pays a floating rate tied to a benchmark such as LIBOR.

Spread: The spread in swaps refers to the difference between the rates of two similar financial instruments. This is commonly used in interest rate swaps and credit default swaps. A simple use case could be an interest rate spread swap, where the payment from one party is tied to the difference between two benchmark interest rates, like the LIBOR and the Treasury bill rate.

Curve: The curve in the context of swaps refers to the yield curve, which plots the yield of bonds (or interest rates) against different maturity dates. A use case could be an investor examining the yield curve to determine if it's currently a good time to enter a long-term swap contract, based on the interest rate environment.

Curve Spread: This term refers to the difference between two yield curves, typically reflecting different credit risks. A use case could be comparing the yield curve for government bonds and corporate bonds â€“ the difference in yields between these two curves is the curve spread, which can reflect the credit risk associated with corporate bonds.

Fly (butterfly): A butterfly (or "fly") is a type of spread that involves three options or futures contracts with different maturity dates or strike prices. In the swaps market, a butterfly strategy could involve contracts with short, medium, and long-term maturities. The goal is to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve.

CME Rate: This refers to the rate (typically an interest rate) of a swap contract traded on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group's derivatives marketplaces.

CME Spread: This refers to the spread of a swap contract traded on the CME. This could represent the difference between the fixed and floating rates in an interest rate swap, for example.

CME Curve Spread: In the context of the CME, a curve spread would refer to the difference between two points on the yield curve derived from interest rates of swap contracts traded on the CME.

CME Fly: A CME fly would refer to a butterfly spread strategy implemented using swap contracts traded on the CME. As above, this would involve contracts with different maturities to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve.

CME: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group operates several large derivatives and futures exchanges. It offers a marketplace for trading swaps, including interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and others.
