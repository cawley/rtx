# Trade Types
Rate: In the swaps market, the rate is the agreed upon exchange rate between two parties in the contract. A simple use case could be a plain vanilla interest rate swap, where one party agrees to pay a fixed rate, while the other pays a floating rate tied to a benchmark such as LIBOR.

## Spread: 

The spread in swaps refers to the difference between the rates of two similar financial instruments. This is commonly used in interest rate swaps and credit default swaps. A simple use case could be an interest rate spread swap, where the payment from one party is tied to the difference between two benchmark interest rates, like the LIBOR and the Treasury bill rate.

A spread swap is a derivative contract where the return is based on the spread between two reference rates. Typically, these are interest rates, but they could also be yields on different types of bonds, commodities prices, or other benchmarks.

The two parties in the swap will agree to exchange cash flows based on this spread. For example, one party might pay the other an amount based on the difference between the interest rate on 10-year Treasury bonds and the LIBOR rate, multiplied by some notional amount.

Why might a trader be interested in using spread swaps? There are several potential reasons:

Speculation: If a trader has a view on how the spread between two rates will change in the future, they could enter a spread swap to profit from this view. For example, if they believe that the spread between corporate bonds and Treasury bonds will widen (because they believe corporate bonds will become riskier relative to Treasuries), they might enter a swap where they receive the spread and pay a fixed rate. If the spread does widen, they'll receive larger payments.

Hedging: If a trader has a position that's exposed to changes in the spread between two rates, they could use a spread swap to hedge this risk. For instance, if a bank has made a lot of loans tied to the LIBOR rate but funded these loans with bonds tied to the Treasury rate, they're exposed to the risk of the spread between these rates changing. They could hedge this risk with a spread swap.

Arbitrage: If a trader identifies a mispricing in the market, they could use spread swaps to profit from this. For example, if the spread between two rates in the swap market is different from the spread in the bond market, a trader could use spread swaps and bond trades to lock in a risk-free profit.

So in summary, spread swaps provide traders with a tool to speculate on, hedge against, or arbitrage differences between two reference rates. This can provide additional flexibility and opportunities compared to trading the individual rates themselves.

Curve: The curve in the context of swaps refers to the yield curve, which plots the yield of bonds (or interest rates) against different maturity dates. A use case could be an investor examining the yield curve to determine if it's currently a good time to enter a long-term swap contract, based on the interest rate environment.

Curve Spread: This term refers to the difference between two yield curves, typically reflecting different credit risks. A use case could be comparing the yield curve for government bonds and corporate bonds â€“ the difference in yields between these two curves is the curve spread, which can reflect the credit risk associated with corporate bonds.

Fly (butterfly): A butterfly (or "fly") is a type of spread that involves three options or futures contracts with different maturity dates or strike prices. In the swaps market, a butterfly strategy could involve contracts with short, medium, and long-term maturities. The goal is to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve.

CME Rate: This refers to the rate (typically an interest rate) of a swap contract traded on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group's derivatives marketplaces.

CME Spread: This refers to the spread of a swap contract traded on the CME. This could represent the difference between the fixed and floating rates in an interest rate swap, for example.

CME Curve Spread: In the context of the CME, a curve spread would refer to the difference between two points on the yield curve derived from interest rates of swap contracts traded on the CME.

CME Fly: A CME fly would refer to a butterfly spread strategy implemented using swap contracts traded on the CME. As above, this would involve contracts with different maturities to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve.

CME: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group operates several large derivatives and futures exchanges. It offers a marketplace for trading swaps, including interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and others.
