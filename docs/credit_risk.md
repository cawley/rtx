Credit risk plays a significant role in swap pricing. Swap contracts are typically not fully collateralized and hence, each party to the swap is exposed to the risk that the other party might default on its contractual obligations. This risk of default is known as counterparty credit risk.

1. **Credit Spreads**: If one party to the swap has a higher perceived risk of default (i.e., lower credit rating), the other party will demand compensation for bearing this extra risk. This compensation is reflected in the credit spread, which increases the overall swap rate for the higher-risk party.

2. **Collateral Agreements**: To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the parties to a swap may agree to post collateral. The need for collateral will depend on the creditworthiness of the parties and can impact the pricing of the swap. High-quality collateral can help reduce the credit spread and thus the overall cost of the swap for a higher-risk party.

3. **Expected Exposure**: The pricing of a swap may also take into account the expected exposure, which is an estimate of the potential future credit exposure over the lifetime of the swap. This measure can be complex to calculate, as it needs to take into account potential future changes in market variables.

4. **Probability of Default**: The price of a swap will also take into account the estimated probability of default by each party, based on factors such as their credit ratings and financial condition.

5. **Credit Value Adjustment (CVA)**: This is an adjustment to the risk-free price of the swap to account for the counterparty credit risk. CVA is essentially the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty. It is calculated as the difference between the risk-free value of the swap and the risky value of the swap.

6. **Debt Valuation Adjustment (DVA)**: DVA is the adjustment made for the entity's own credit risk. If the entity's creditworthiness worsens, DVA results in a gain as it would cost less to replace the contract if the entity defaults.

It's important to note that since the financial crisis, there has been a move towards central clearing of swaps through clearinghouses. Central clearing mitigates counterparty credit risk because the clearinghouse acts as the counterparty to both sides of the swap, and it requires the parties to post collateral (margin) to cover potential losses. This has significantly reduced, but not completely eliminated, the impact of credit risk on swap pricing.
