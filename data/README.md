### 1. Client Makes a Request: 

The client, or author of the request, sends a request to the server. This request can be in various forms (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) depending on the operation to be performed. The request is typically sent over HTTP/HTTPS, and the URL usually points to a specific resource on the server.

For example, a client might make a GET request to the following URL to retrieve information about a particular user from a server:

```
GET https://api.example.com/users/123
```

### 2. Server Processes the Request: 

The server receives the request and processes it. This usually involves some kind of operation on a database, such as retrieving a record, updating a record, or deleting a record.

### 3. Server Responds:

Once the server has completed the operation, it sends a response back to the client. This response usually contains a status code indicating whether the operation was successful (like 200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.) and any requested data. The data is typically formatted as JSON, which is a lightweight and widely supported data format.

In response to the earlier GET request, the server might send back a response like the following:

```json
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

### 4. Client Processes the Response: 

Once the client receives the response, it processes the data as needed. This might involve updating the user interface, storing the data for later use, or triggering other operations.

In Python, for example, the client might use the requests library to make the request and handle the response:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users/123')

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"User ID: {data['id']}")
    print(f"User Name: {data['name']}")
    print(f"User Email: {data['email']}")
else:
    print(f"Request failed with status code {response.status_code}")
```

This script sends a GET request to the server, checks the status code of the response, and if the request was successful, prints out the user's ID, name, and email.

### 5. Client Stores the Data: 
Depending on the needs of the application, the client might store the data locally for later use. This could involve saving the data to a file, storing it in a database, or keeping it in memory.

If we wanted to store the returned user data in a .csv file, we might modify our Python script like so:

```python
import requests
import csv

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users/123')

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    with open('user_data.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow(['ID', 'Name', 'Email'])
        writer.writerow([data['id'], data['name'], data['email']])
else:
    print(f"Request failed with status code {response.status_code}")
```
