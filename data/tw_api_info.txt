Twelve Data authenticates users by valid API keys for both API and WebSocket. It can be specified in two ways:

At query string, as &apikey=your_api_key
At header, as Authorization="apikey your_api_key"

A demo API key is used for sample requests to familiarize yourself with the API format. 
Complete access to API is available with your API key.
Specific endpoints are available starting only from Grow, Pro, or Enterprise plans. 
However, they all can be tested as trial symbols across all markets. 
API will return an error if the key is invalid or has insufficient permissions.

API endpoints are prefixed with https://api.twelvedata.com
WebSocket endpoints are prefixed with wss://ws.twelvedata.com

How to separate
Parameters are ampersand(&) separated.
E.g. ?symbol=AAPL&interval=5min&output=200

Casting
Word casing doesnâ€˜t matter when passing parameters.
E.g. ?symbol=AAPL, ?symbol=AaPl, or ?symbol=aapl will all correctly work.

Exchanges
Symbol might be also passed in the form symbol:exchange_name.
E.g. ?symbol=RY:TSX, ?symbol=AAPL:NASDAQ

CSV
When the format parameter is set to CSV, additional filename parameter might be used to specify the custom name of the output file. E.g. ?format=CSV&filename=my_own_csv_name

Dates
To get the most use of start_date, end_date, and outputsize parameters when accessing historical data, refer to this tutorial.

Request
Basic call
All symbols should be comma delimited and provided in symbol parameter. E.g:
/time_series?symbol=AAPL,QQQ,EUR/USD,IXIC

Exchange specific call
In order to call symbol from the specific exchange, use symbol_ticker:exchange format. E.g:
/bbands?symbol=ETH/BTC:Huobi,TRP:TSX,INFY:BSE

General
All instruments might be called in an arbitrary order and mixes, such as stocks, forex, crypto, ETFs and indices.
Request count will be incremented according to the number of passed symbols.
Batch requests only support JSON format.
Limited to 120 symbols per request.

Response
The response consists of the main object where the key is the symbol passed and value is the normal object consisting of meta, values, status.
The response header will also include is_batch set to true if the request is batch with multiple returns symbols.

Error handling
In the case that there was an error during processing one of the symbols, the error will only be returned for that specific symbol without affecting other instrument responses.
